# Working Yarn Workspaces Monorepo 
Monorepo proof of concept using yarn workspaces with:
1. Nextjs application
2. External js library
3. External jsx component library
4. Typescript support (though not used)
5. Successfully builds with jss styled components

## Todo
1. Set up scripts to run app commands from root. As of now, you need to cd into the `web-app` directory and run yarn commands directly in there.

## Caveats
**Best to use latest version of yarn**
`yarn set version latest`
